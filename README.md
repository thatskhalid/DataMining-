## Section C

Our objective is to determine and come up with insights about the vehicle selling market by utilizing datasets. These insights can include the current state of the market, certain vehicle purchase trends, what customers prefer, and external factors that can affect prices. This project aims to clean our datasets and do some analysis and exploration which will result in investigating the following: what vehicles are popular, what makes a vehicle worth more, and what patterns can influence what is sold and bought.

Our insights will contain details regarding what external factors can increase vehicle sales, these can include make and model, condition, mileage, color, location, and more. Our final piece of research will result in a predictive model that can give potential trends of future vehicle sales based on its defining qualities. 

Questions:
1) What is the most popular selling vehicle across the various regions?
2) What correlation is there between condition and selling price?
3) How much of an impact do factors such as mileage, color, and year have on vehicle pricing?
