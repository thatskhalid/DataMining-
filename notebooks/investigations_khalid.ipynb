    "1) Obscured selling price for some vehicles\n",
    "2) Unrealistic high odometer readings\n",
    "3) Low condition ratings for vehicles with extremely low mileage\n",
    "4) Older vehicles with high selling prices\n",
    "5) Multiple vehicles with odometer readings in the hundreds of thousands\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "1) Why were some vehicles selling for incredibly high prices\n",
    "It is possible that some of these vehicles were high-performance luxury cars with high value\n",
    "\n",
    "These vehicles were in pristine condition with low mileage\n",
    "\n",
    "Could be an error \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why did some vehicles have unrealistic high odometer readings?\n",
    "This could be a data error \n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle could have been some kind of project to test the engine's endurance\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle was list with the incorrect information\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Why did some vehicles have low condition ratings with low mileage?\n",
    "Vehicle could have been involved in an accident\n",
    "\n",
    "Could be an error in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle lost its value over time while sitting at a dealer and subsequently also worsened in condition\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Why did some older vehicle sell with high price tags?\n",
    "These vehicles could have been classics\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicles could have in incredibly nice condition and kept its value over time\n",
    "\n",
    "This could have been another error \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Why do some vehicles have odomter readings in the hundreds of thousands?\n",
    "Some vehicles are incredibly reliable and were built to last, this is not out of the ordinary\n",
    "\n",
    "These vehicles were kept in good condition and had proper maintenance done, combined with engine reliability, they kept its value\n",

    "After reviewing the CSV with pandas, we can come to the following conclusion: The higher priced vehicles were warrented due to their adequate attributes.\n",
    "The 2014 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe selling for 67,000 makes sense due its high condition rating at 43, as well as its incredibly low mileage of 2641.\n",
    "Another example explained would be the 2015 Volvo S60 which sold for 27,750 but had reasonably low mileage at 14,282 as well as a high condition rating.\n",
    "Basically, many of these high priced vehicles had price tags that made sense. The vehicle ended up being sold for what it was worth. \n",
    "In a previous assignment, we also investiagted other German cars that had similar coniditon ratings and mileage and still maintained their value and were sold for a lot.\n",
    "One notable example was the 2014 BMW M5 which sold for 65,000. Considering it was an M series car, the unusual high price tag for a 2014 car made sense.\n",
    "Further analysis will prove that unless there are errors in individual vehicle data, a lot of these cars are worth for what they are being sold for. \n"
